# responsive-web-design
Repository to upload complete and work-in-progress sites from my responsive-web-design course.

The sites become more advanced as the course progresses.

simple-tribute-page is a basic HTML page, with text and some basic CSS properties.

responsive-web-form builds on basic HTML features, by introducing a form, built with bootstrap to show how elements can be displayed, formatted and how forms are submitted.

product-landing-page has been built entirely with bootstrap, to create a fluid, responsive site which works on and aspect ratio or browser. Including a form which submits data to another page for processing, a carousel of images, Youtube integration and the google maps API.
